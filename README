| Version Number               | --version                    |Prints the version number                                       |

| Minimum SNR                  | --minSnr=4.0                 |This filter removes data that is likely to contain              |

| Minimum Number of Passes     | --minPasses=3                |Sets a minimum number of passes for a ZMW to be emitted. This   |
